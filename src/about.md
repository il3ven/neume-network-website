Web3 Music has developed significantly since the early days of 2015/16. Initial ideas have become relatively successful experiments, attracting [c.$90m](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFGL73BMfVtgM3dOR8wRmOoXYC-d7AHRcq5rQENg5l0/edit?usp=sharing) in primary sales of music NFTs in 2021. Social tokens are starting to power artist owned universes for their fans, such as [racOS](https://rac.fm/). 

However, challenges remain:
* Normalising the differing approaches to the definition of NFTs, from metadata through to token standards
* Identity, ownership, trust, and veracity of statements made, across decentralised on-chain accounts
* The value of coordination and curation within product asset models
* The complexity of copyright and permissions in a blockchain anchored ecosystem 

The current state of art constrains developers that are seeking to build experiences within this emerging ecosystem.

neume is solving these challenges through [social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html) by facilitating an implementation process that seeds and builds the momentum of decentralised contribution.

We believe that neume will unlock the next phase of growth of the Web3 Music industry through open infrastructure that brings scale benefits to experimentation.

neume is an open source project supported by [HIFI Labs](https://www.hifilabs.co/)
